```html
<div class="letter-content">
    
    <p><p>Happy 27th Birthday, my love!</p>
    
    <p>As you turn 27, I want you to know how incredibly special you are. You are kind, warm and incredibly loving. I've met very few people who can make others feel so, so comfortable around you. You are loyal, brave and so smart. Biggest of all, you have a heart made of gold. I've never met anyone quite like you.</p>
    
    <p>Your smile lights up my world, your laugh is my favorite sound, and your love makes me the happiest person alive. Your eyes are so beautiful that they make me melt. I know we had a bit of a scare these past 2-3 days, but someday, I really hope to see those very eyes on a tiny version of us. Thank you for being you - for being my partner, my best friend, my everything.</p>
    
    <p>I can't wait to create more beautiful memories with you this year and for many years to come. Here's to another amazing year of adventures, laughter, and love!</p>
    
    <p>I love you more than words can say. Happy Birthday, my heart! 🎂💖</p>
    
    <p class="letter-signature">Forever yours,<br>Bubu ❤️</p>
