🎵 TO ADD BIRTHDAY MUSIC:

1. Download a Happy Birthday MP3 file
   - Free options: pixabay.com/music or bensound.com
   - Search for "happy birthday" or "celebration music"

2. Rename the file to: birthday-music.mp3

3. Place it in this folder (same location as this text file)

4. That's it! The music button will work automatically

---

The website works perfectly without music too!
The music button just won't play anything until you add the file.
