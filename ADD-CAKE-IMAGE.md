# 🎂 How to Add Your Cake Image

## What I Need:

A cake image with a **transparent background** (PNG format)

## Steps:

1. **Save your cake image** as: `cake.png`
2. **Put it in the same folder** as `index.html`
3. **Let me know** and I'll update the code to use it!

## Recommended Image:

- **Format**: PNG with transparent background
- **Size**: Around 400-600px width works best
- **Style**: Cute animated birthday cake

## Where to Get One:

If you don't have one, try:
- Search "cute birthday cake transparent background PNG"
- Sites like: pngtree.com, freepik.com, flaticon.com
- Or I can help you find one!

**Once you add `cake.png` to the folder, tell me and I'll integrate it!** 🎂
